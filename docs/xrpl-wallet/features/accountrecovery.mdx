title: Account Recovery
---

Torus's OAuth logins inherits account recovery and management mechanisms of
existing account management systems \(eg, Google's password recovery system, or
Facebook's security questions\). If user's forgets their password, they can just
use familiar recovery tools to recover their login.

Beyond this, the Torus team cannot help you to retrieve your private key, since
we can't get access to your 3rd-party OAuth accounts.

This also means that if your 3rd-party OAuth account is hacked, the hacker can
gain access to your account. Please follow best practices by protecting your
logins with 2FA \(eg. [Google 2FA](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/)\).
