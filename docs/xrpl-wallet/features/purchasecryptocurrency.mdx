title: Purchasing Cryptocurrency
---

Torus has a range of providers to allow your users to purchase cryptocurrencies
directly with credit card/wire transfer. Developers can either access this
through presenting the "Topup" page below, or trigger the fiat-to-crypto
providers directly from the API.

Its worth noting that as the fiat-to-Crypto landscape is a complex and regulated
industry, each provider comes with their pros and cons. Currently, we only support Ramp Network on Solana.

Through these third-party providers, we currently support direct purchase of
SOLANA_SOL, SOLANA_USDC and more on solana network.
