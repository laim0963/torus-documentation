title: Purchasing Cryptocurrency

Torus has a range of providers to allow your users to purchase cryptocurrencies
directly with credit card/wire transfer. Developers can either access this
by presenting the "Topup" page below or trigger the fiat-to-crypto
providers directly from the API.

It's worth noting that as the fiat-to-Crypto landscape is a complex and regulated
industry, each provider comes with their pros and cons. Currently, we support Simplex and
Topper as providers.

Through these third-party providers, we currently support the direct purchase of
XRP.
