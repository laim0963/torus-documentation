The XRPL wallet is designed specifically for storing, managing, and transacting with digital assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRPL is the underlying technology for the XRP cryptocurrency and is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.

The [XRPL wallet](https://xrpl.tor.us) lets users securely store their XRP and other supported digital assets, such as issued tokens and stablecoins. Typically, XRPL wallets provide users with a unique cryptographic address, which serves as a unique identifier for the wallet and enables users to receive XRP and other assets from other parties.

It is essential to note that XRPL wallets differ from cryptocurrency exchanges since they give users direct control over their private keys. This means that users have full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

XRPL Wallet uses Web3Auth and directly connects to the XRPL blockchain. It supports OAuth Social logins and fiat-to-crypto, among other features.
