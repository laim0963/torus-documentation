An XRPL wallet is a digital wallet that is specially designed for storing,
managing, and transacting with digital assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRPL
serves as the underlying technology for the XRP cryptocurrency and is an
open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.

With an XRPL wallet, users can securely store their XRP and other supported
digital assets, including issued tokens and stablecoins. The wallet facilitates
various transactions on the XRPL network and comes in different forms, such as
desktop, mobile, or web-based software applications and hardware devices like
hardware wallets.

XRPL wallets usually provide users a unique cryptographic address, an XRP
Ledger, or simply an XRP address. This address serves as a unique identifier for
the wallet and enables users to receive XRP and other assets from other parties.

Users can perform various actions when using an XRPL wallet, such as sending and
receiving XRP, managing account settings, checking transaction history, and
interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) built on the XRPL. Some
wallets may offer additional features like multi-signature support, exchange
integration, and market data.

It is important to note that XRPL wallets differ from cryptocurrency exchanges
because they give users direct control over their private keys, which means that
users have full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

XRPL Wallet uses the OpenLogin flows and directly connects to the XRPL
blockchain. It supports OAuth Social logins and fiat-to-crypto, among other
features.
