title: Designing your Key Management Architecture
---

This document is an aggregation of several questions which may help determine
the architecture that fits your application and users best.

## Which logins should my application support?

With the CustomAuth integration, you can select a combination of logins from
this [list](verifiers). There are some nuances with certain login providers, so
don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Should different logins lead to the same key?

You can choose to connect logins with the same verifierID. For example if a user
uses generic email logins and a gmail login to login on different occasions
he/she can still retrieve the same key. This can only be done on logins which
share a common unique identifier for a user. Read more about
[aggregating logins](verifiers#aggregating-loginsverifiers).

## Which platforms does my application need to be on?

CustomAuth is compatible on both web, mobile, native and even CLI applications,
which means developers can integrate its key management solutions regardless of
their specific infrastructure of choice. It is important to ensure that all
platforms in which the key is access are front-end/client side device, in most
cases.

## How does CustomAuth fit with XXX?

The small API surface also means CustomAuth is composable - you can combine it
with a meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and other cryptographic protocols. Its
easy to build ontop of and generally we fit with most other technology stacks,
including but not limited to; your flavour scalability solutions, meta
transactions, smart contract wallets, different elliptic curve pairs and even
RSA.
