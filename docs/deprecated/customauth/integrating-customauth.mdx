Design a key management architecture that suites your user base.

Depending on your application's platform we have different SDKs for integrating
CustomAuth:

- [WebSDK in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth)
- [Android in Java SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-android-sdk)
- [IOS Swift SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-swift-sdk)
- [Native SDK in Java](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-utils-java)
- [React Native Sdk in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-react-native-sdk)

These SDKs implement interactions with the Torus Network which are detailed more
closely
[here](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612)
and
[here](/key-infrastructure/technical-architecture#verifiers-and-key-retrieval).
Each of the SDKs go into further detail with exact implementation details and
example code within their readme's.

The steps for integration are:

1. **[Designing your key management architecture](designing-your-key-management-architecture):**
   decide on which logins (verifiers) you'd like to implement, your
   authentication structure and more

2. **Deploying to testnet & implement**: once you've designed your key
   management architecture for your app we can deploy your app-specific verifier
   scripts on the Torus Network. This is done by submitting an append only
   transaction that creates the verifier scripts. These are highly limited in
   updatability thus most applications to test out the deployed scripts on
   testnet first. Once deployed, the application can then access and use these
   verifier scripts via one or more of our SDKs.

3. **Deploying to mainnet**: and finally once before entering production be sure
   to convert/deploy your verifier to mainnet
   [all deployments are done on the developer dashboard](https://developer.tor.us)
