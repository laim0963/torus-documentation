In this section, you'll find SDKs which have been discontinued, with limited
developer support available around their integration. This was done in favour of
creating our one stop SDK for authentication needs -
[Web3Auth](https://docs.web3auth.io). Web3Auth which handles your all web3
authentication needs under one umbrella.

## Web3Auth vs CustomAuth

---

Web3Auth provides a secure and uniform flow, which is highly customisable
according the user needs. It is important to understand that
[Web3Auth with Custom Authentication](https://docs.web3auth.io/customauth/) is
different from one of the deprecated SDKs here, Torus CustomAuth.

If you're using Torus CustomAuth, it has different properties from Web3Auth's
custom authentication in that it doesn't utilize the users device and other
factors. The Custom Authentication in Web3Auth enables users to have the same
Web3Auth flow across their applications, while having the flexibility of using
their own authentication system. On the other hand, CustomAuth just provides
Torus's key infrastructure and enable more people to join in using their own
portal and methods.

## Web3Auth vs OpenLogin

---

OpenLogin is essentially Web3Auth. In Web3Auth, we extended the features of
OpenLogin to make it more accessible and customisable according to user needs,
If you have wanna read more about Web3Auth, make to sure to checkout the
[documentation](https://docs.web3auth.io).
