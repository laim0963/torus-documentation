## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you over a basic example to integerate Openlogin
authentication with polygon network (previously matic).

We will go through a react app where user can login,create polygon wallet
address, fetch matic erc20 token balance and logout.

You can find
[the source code of this is example on Github](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-polygon-example).

## Register your OpenLogin application

In order to use OpenLogin SDK, you'll need to create a project in
[Developer Dashboard](https://developer.tor.us) and get your client ID.

> App registration is not required for localhost development.

## Let's get started with code by installing depedencies using npm

To start with using openlogin with a polygon(matic) dapp , you need to install
[Openlogin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/openlogin) ,
[Web3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) sdk and
[@maticnetwork/maticjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maticnetwork/maticjs)
sdk

```shell
    npm install --save @toruslabs/openlogin
    npm install --save @maticnetwork/maticjs
    npm install --save web3
```

## Initialize matic web3 lib to connect with matic network

```js
const maticClient = {
  _matic: null,
  _network: null,
  connect: async (_network, _version) => {
    const network = new Network(_network, _version);
    console.log(network.Main.RPC, network.Matic.RPC);
    const matic = new Matic({
      network: _network,
      version: _version,
      parentProvider: new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
        "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/73d0b3b9a4b2499da81c71a2b2a473a9"
      ),
      maticProvider: new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(network.Matic.RPC),
    });
    await matic.initialize();
    maticClient._matic = matic;
    maticClient._network = network;
    return { matic, network };
  },
  getClient: async (_network, _version) => {
    if (maticClient._matic && maticClient._network) {
      return { matic: maticClient._matic, network: maticClient._network };
    }
    return await maticClient.connect(_network, _version);
  },
};
```

## Create and initialize openlogin instance

Start with creating a instance of openlogin class and initialize it using
`openlogin.init()` when application is mounted. After initialization it checks
if sdk has private key then user is already logged in.

We are using two options while creating openlogin class instance:-

- `clientId`: clientId is a public id which is used to to identify your app. You
  can generate your client id from
  [developer dashboard](http://developer.tor.us/). For localhost you can use any
  static random string as client id.

- `network`: network can be `testnet` or `mainnet`.

```js

  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true)
    const sdkInstance = new OpenLogin({
      clientId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      network: "testnet"
    });
    async function initializeOpenlogin() {
      await sdkInstance.init();
      if (sdkInstance.privKey) {
        // qpp has access ot private key now
        ...
        ...
      }
      setSdk(sdkInstance);
      setLoading(false)
    }
    initializeOpenlogin();
  }, []);

```

## Login

Once the sdk is initialized , then `openlogin.login` should be called when user
clicks on login button.

```js
async function handleLogin() {
  // privKey will be returned here only in case of popup mode or in case user is already logged in.
  // for redirect mode login, private key will be returned as `openlogin.privKey` after openlogin
  // is initialized using `init` function on successfully login redirect.
  const privKey = await openlogin.login({
    loginProvider: "google",
    redirectUrl: `${window.origin}`,
  });
  return privKey;
}
```

Above code snippet will start the login flow for the user and redirect/popups
openlogin authentication ui for user based on the ux mode specified.

Openlogin sdk provides two UX modes (ie POPUP and REDIRECT) for login flow. You
can use either depends on your application UX by setting up `uxMode` option in
login function, default is `redirect`.

> Note: in above function, privKey will be returned here only in case of popup
> ux mode or in case user is already logged in. For redirect mode login, private
> key will be returned as `openlogin.privKey` after openlogin is initialized
> using `init` function which should be called redirect url page mount.

In redirect mode user will be redirected completely out of app and will be
redirected back to `redirectUrl` after successfull authentication, application
will have access to private key as `openlogin.privKey` after intializing
`openlogin` instance.

In PopUp mode, openlogin authenication window will open as a popup and app will
get private key when `openlogin.login` promise will resolve.

This example is compatible with both redirect and popup ux modes.

In the given code snippet, `openlogin.login` function is getting called along
with two options:-

- `loginProvider`: It specifies the login method which will be used to
  authenticate user. You can checkout
  [API Reference](/deprecated/open-login/api-reference/usage) to know about all
  supported and custom login provider values.

- `redirectUrl`: User will be redirected to redirectUrl after login.

Checkout [API Reference](/deprecated/open-login/api-reference/usage) for other
options available to pass in openlogin constructor and login function.

## Use the private key with @maticnetwork/maticjs

In the code snippet below we are using user's private key with matic network ,
it uses `matic` client which we connected earlier in this guide , imports a
account with private key and fetches imported account erc20 token balance from
matic network.

```js
const getMaticAccountDetails = useCallback(
  async (privateKey) => {
    const { matic, network } = await maticClient.getClient("mainnet", "v1");
    const tokenAddress = network.Matic.Contracts.Tokens.MaticToken;
    matic.setWallet(privateKey);

    const account =
      matic.web3Client.web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
    let address = account.address;

    const balance = await matic.balanceOfERC20(
      address, //User address
      tokenAddress, // Token address
      {
        parent: false,
      }
    );
    setUserAccountInfo({ balance, address });
  },
  [getMaticClient]
);
```

## Log out handler

In order to logout user you needs to call logout function available on sdk
instance. Logout function will clears the sdk state and removes any access to
private key on frontend.

You can pass various other options in logout function like `fastLogin` ,
`redirectUrl` etc. To know more about that checkout
[API Reference](/deprecated/open-login/api-reference/usage).

```js
const handleLogout = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  await openlogin.logout();
  setLoading(false);
};
```
